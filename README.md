# Description

A teaching example for when and how to use classes.

The `Database` class is introduced to group all database-related operations in a central location to clear up the code in the routes found in [./main.py].

An additional benefit is that it is now possible to test database access functions without having to make HTTP requests and that interacting with the databse from the interactive Python console becomes easier.
